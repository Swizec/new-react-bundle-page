            <p>Mastering React and Redux can get you a position in web development or help you build that personal project you've been dreaming of. It's a skill that will put you more in demand in the modern web development industry, especially with the release of Redux and ReactNative.</p>

            <p>SurviveJS - React shows you how to build a simple Kanban. The idea is that if you can build a simple application, you can probably build something more complex after that. The first application is always the hardest.</p>

            <p>In addition to fundamental React knowledge, you will pick up design techniques as you develop the application step by step and learn to understand it in detail.</p>

            <p>We think that React.js is the best choice when it comes to build dynamic frontends. We used it in <b>5 big projects we were working on</b>. We got <b>over 2000+ hours of experience</b> with it. And we want to share our knowledge with you - and we already do. We got a Rails meets React.js book, aimed to Ruby on Rails developers. Weâ€™ve created and maintain the React.js koans (2000+ stars on GitHub already!).</p>

            <p>We wrote <b>a book which is a perfect entry point</b> to this world of the modern JavaScript tooling. Itâ€™s not a full ES2015 bible, nor is it a full React.js API description. We went straight to the main value - how you can implement typical UI widgets. This is the focus on the book, <b>as many practical examples as possible</b>. You will learn different ways of approaching a typical JavaScript task - building a specific widget.</p>

            <p>The early part of the book explains why Webpack is needed, shows you how to develop Webpack configuration of your own step by step, and then moves onto more advanced topics.</p>

            <p>I chose an approach that allows me to discuss one technique at a time. This makes the book handy for reference.</p>

            <p>The book covers actually more than just Webpack. You will learn also about the surrounding ecosystem. This means you will learn to improve the quality of your code using tools such as ESLint. There are also React specific tips given this book originates from the first one.</p>
